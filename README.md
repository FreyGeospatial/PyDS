A repository of mostly old (but some new) python scripts to clean and analyze sample data. Although my main love is R, Python was the first language I learned and I acknowledge that Python is the industry standard for data engineers and is widely used by Data Scientists for both exploratory and production-level projects. This repository is meant to be a staging ground (albeit a chaotic one) to showcase fundamental knowledge of Python for data-centric roles. More advanced or niche scripts (e.g., python scripts relating to Spark, database interactions, GIS/geospatial analysis) or old school assignments will be found in my other repositories.As of 4/12/2022, I am going to keep some random- and not necessarily data science specific (but useful to know) scripts here. They will be illustrating various Python functionality and best practices.
