A repository of mostly old (but some new) python scripts to clean and analyze sample data. Although my main love is R, Python was the first language I learned and I acknowledge that Python has become the industry standard for data engineers and scientists. This repository is meant to be a staging ground (albeit a chaotic one) to showcase knowledge of Python in general. Projects and topics that I feel deserve their own repository will be found in other repos.
