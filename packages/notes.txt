A python egg (.egg extension) is a logical structure embodying the release of a specific version of a python project. An egg comprises its code, resources, and metadata. There are multiple formats that can be used to physically encode a python egg.

A python egg should be DISCOVERABLE and IMPORTABLE. A python application should be able to easily and efficiently find out what eggs are present ona system and ensure its contents are importable.

Eggs should also be easily distributed, and also easily uninstalled.

They are an alternative to .exe, and are cross platform.


Example:
#############################


# setup.py
from setuptools import setup, find_packages
setup(
    name = "mymath",
    version = "0.1",
    packages = find_packages()
    )

#########################
To create a .egg for a directory, do:

 $ python setup.py develop

 ######################################


this will generate a lot of outputs, but it will have three new folders:
1) build
2) dist
3) mymath.egg-info

The dist folder will contain the .egg file (mymath-0.1-py3.5.egg). py3.5 signifies local python version, so mine might be >=3.9.5

HOWEVER... I have done some searching, and some people note that eggs are becoming/have become obsolete due to introduction of wheels. Unknown how true this is, but should keep in mind for future.
